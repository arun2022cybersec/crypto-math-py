## Mathematical Theory of Relations

### Definition of Relations

A **relation** is a set of ordered pairs that describes a relationship between elements of two sets. If A and B are two sets, a relation R from A to B is a subset of the Cartesian product A × B.

### Notation

- If a ∈ A and b ∈ B, then the ordered pair (a, b) is in the relation R if a is related to b by R.
- This is denoted as a R b.

### Types of Relations

1. **Reflexive Relation**: A relation R on a set A is reflexive if for every element a ∈ A, (a, a) ∈ R.

2. **Symmetric Relation**: A relation R is symmetric if whenever (a, b) ∈ R, then (b, a) ∈ R.

3. **Transitive Relation**: A relation R is transitive if whenever (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then (a, c) ∈ R.

4. **Anti-symmetric Relation**: A relation R is anti-symmetric if whenever (a, b) ∈ R and (b, a) ∈ R, then a = b.

5. **Equivalence Relation**: A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

6. **Partial Order**: A relation that is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive.

### Properties of Relations

- **Domain**: The set of all first elements of the ordered pairs in a relation.
- **Range**: The set of all second elements of the ordered pairs in a relation.
- **Inverse Relation**: For a relation R, the inverse relation R^{-1} consists of all pairs (b, a) such that (a, b) ∈ R.
