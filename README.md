# CryptoMathPy

CryptoMathPy is a Python project that explores the intersection of cryptography, mathematics, and Python programming. It begins with fundamental mathematical concepts such as set theory, relations, and functions, and gradually progresses to advanced topics like group theory and Galois fields. The project culminates in the implementation of various encryption and decryption algorithms, demonstrating practical applications of cryptographic techniques in Python.

## Features

- **Mathematical Foundations**: Implement mathematical concepts of sets, relations, functions, group theory, and Galois fields in Python.
- **Encryption Algorithms**: Develop encryption algorithms including AES, RSA, and others.
- **Decryption Algorithms**: Implement corresponding decryption algorithms for encrypted data.
- **Python Applications**: Create Python applications for encryption, decryption, and data security.
- **Documentation and Examples**: Provide comprehensive documentation and usage examples for each implemented concept and algorithm.
