# Group Theory

## Definition of Groups

A **group** is a set G equipped with a binary operation (usually denoted as multiplication) that combines any two elements a and b to form another element, denoted as a * b. The set and operation must satisfy four fundamental properties known as the group axioms:

1. **Closure**: For all a, b in G, the result of the operation a * b is also in G.
2. **Associativity**: For all a, b, and c in G, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).
3. **Identity Element**: There exists an element e in G such that for every element a in G, the equation e * a = a * e = a holds.
4. **Inverse Element**: For each a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a * b = b * a = e, where e is the identity element.

## Examples of Groups

1. **Integers under Addition**: The set of integers Z with the operation of addition (+) forms a group. The identity element is 0, and the inverse of any integer a is -a.
2. **Non-zero Real Numbers under Multiplication**: The set of non-zero real numbers R* with the operation of multiplication (*) forms a group. The identity element is 1, and the inverse of any real number a is 1/a.

## Subgroups

A **subgroup** is a subset H of a group G that is itself a group under the operation of G. For H to be a subgroup, it must satisfy the following conditions:

1. **Non-empty**: H is not empty.
2. **Closure**: For all a, b in H, the result of the operation a * b is also in H.
3. **Identity Element**: The identity element of G is in H.
4. **Inverse Element**: For each a in H, the inverse of a in G is also in H.

## Cyclic Groups

A **cyclic group** is a group that can be generated by a single element. This means that every element of the group can be written as a power of a particular element called a generator. If G is a cyclic group with generator g, then every element of G can be written as g^n for some integer n.

## Group Homomorphisms

A **group homomorphism** is a function between two groups that respects the group operation. If (G, *) and (H, ·) are groups, a homomorphism f: G -> H satisfies the property:

f(a * b) = f(a) · f(b) for all a, b in G.

## Properties of Group Homomorphisms

1. **Preservation of Identity**: f(e_G) = e_H, where e_G is the identity element of G and e_H is the identity element of H.
2. **Preservation of Inverses**: f(a^-1) = f(a)^-1 for all a in G.

## Examples of Group Homomorphisms

1. **Addition Modulo n**: The function f: Z -> Z_n defined by f(a) = a mod n is a group homomorphism.
2. **Determinant**: The function det: GL(n, R) -> R* that maps a matrix to its determinant is a group homomorphism.

## Applications of Group Theory

1. **Cryptography**: Group theory is used in various cryptographic algorithms, including RSA and ECC.
2. **Physics**: Groups are used to describe symmetries in physical systems.
3. **Chemistry**: Group theory helps in understanding the symmetry of molecules and predicting their properties.

## Conclusion

Group theory is a fundamental area of mathematics with wide-ranging applications in various fields. Understanding the basic concepts of groups, subgroups, cyclic groups, and group homomorphisms provides a strong foundation for exploring more advanced topics and applications.
