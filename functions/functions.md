## Mathematical Theory of Functions

### Definition of Functions

A **function** is a relation that assigns exactly one output (or value) for each input (or argument) from a given set. A function $ f $ from a set $ A $ (the domain) to a set $ B $ (the codomain) is denoted as:

$ f: A \rightarrow B $

### Notation

- If $ a \in A $, then the output of the function is denoted as $ f(a) $, which is the value in the codomain associated with the input $ a $.

### Types of Functions

1. **Injective (One-to-One)**: A function is injective if different inputs map to different outputs. Formally, if $ f(a_1) = f(a_2) $ implies $ a_1 = a_2 $.

2. **Surjective (Onto)**: A function is surjective if every element in the codomain has at least one pre-image in the domain. In other words, the range of the function is equal to the codomain.

3. **Bijective**: A function is bijective if it is both injective and surjective. This means there is a one-to-one correspondence between elements of the domain and codomain.

### Properties of Functions

- **Domain**: The set of all possible inputs for the function.
- **Codomain**: The set of all possible outputs for the function.
- **Range**: The actual set of outputs produced by the function for the given domain.
- **Composition of Functions**: If $ f: A \rightarrow B $ and $ g: B \rightarrow C $, then the composition $ g \circ f: A \rightarrow C $ is defined as $ (g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) $.

### Inverse Functions

If a function $ f $ is bijective, it has an inverse function denoted as $ f^{-1} $, which reverses the mapping of the original function.
